    """ Creates a string with the ticker required to download exchange rates
    using yfinance. The exchange rate will be the price of one unit of the `from_cur` in terms
    of the `to_cur`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    from_cur : str
        The ISO code of the currency to be priced.

    to_cur : str
        The ISO code of the currency with the value of one unit of `from_cur`.


    Returns
    -------
        A string that meets the `yfinance` ticker standards with ALL characters in upper case.
        The function should also be able to ignore leading and trailing spaces. For example,
        " aud", "Aud ", and " AUD " all are treated as "AUD" internally. See the
        Notes section below for more information.

    Notes
    -----
    Yahoo finance uses the following naming rules to define the ticker of the
    exchange rate AAA/BBB:
    usd/aud

    1. If AAA is the USD, then the ticker is "BBB=X", i.e., the second currency
       code with "=X" added at the end.
    2. If AAA is not the USD, then the ticker is "AAABBB=X"

    For example, the ticker for AUD/USD is "AUDUSD=X", while the ticker for
    USD/AUD is "AUD=X"

    So, if `from_cur=AAA` and the `to_cur=BBB`, the YF ticker will be:
    1. "BBB=X" if AAA is USD
    2. "AAABBB=X" if AAA is not the USD
